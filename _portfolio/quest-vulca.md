As a student, it's cool to go in Erasmus+[1] and spend 6 months somewhere abroad in EU. You learn and meet differents culture, people, food and drinks, a different way to see things and basically, it open your mind.
But how to extend or expand this opporunity outside this framewor? Like what about retired people, about non academic people, about in-between-jobs and what about makers?

> [1] *The Erasmus Programme (EuRopean Community Action Scheme for the Mobility of University Students) is a European Union (EU) student exchange programme established in 1987. Erasmus+, or Erasmus Plus, is the new programme combining all the EU's current schemes for education, training, youth and sport, which was started in January 2014.*

> *L'importance que possède ce programme a dépassé le monde académique européen, en étant reconnu comme un élément important favorisant la cohésion et la connaissance de l'Union européenne auprès de la population jeune. Cela a conduit à utiliser le terme de « génération Erasmus » pour qualifier ces étudiants universitaires qui, au travers de cette expérience, ont créé des liens d'amitié internationaux et possèdent une évidente conscience de citoyenneté européenne.*

## My vision of how it could work

Observation:
### About Erasmus
- The exchange is only between University, even if Eramsus+ in not only for students anymore.
- It's only a one-life-time opportunity.
- What do you learn exactly?

### What about Makers?
- How to connect with other?
- How to found where my skills could be usefull?
- Where to learn specific skills?
- How to finance to travel? I still have a rent to pay and all kind of obligation.
- And more importantly,

</figure>
What kind of admin I'll have to do to benefit of this?

### Fablab
- There is some project coming, I miss some skills in my community. How to find people elsewhere? but then I will probably have to pay them more for travel and hosting.
- As a fabmanager, there is an insanely LOT of things to do. I don't want to babysit someone on top of my tasks.  
[Ask me if have I the time for that?](https://s5.favim.com/610/141206/angry-dinossaur-finger-funny-Favim.com-2289765.jpg)   
- I don't know you! How do I know you're not full of BS?
- And more importantly,

During **Octobermake**, in Moulin (France), we gathered with 15-ish fablab's representatives from EU

Mobility, trust, know-how and badges.
