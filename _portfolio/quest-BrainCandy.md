### Because we want to share IRL

I spent so much time on front of the screen, discovering new channels on youtube, watching a lot of tv-series and movies, documentary, ...   
There is this time where I get so excited by what I just learn, It's so cool and awesome, I want to do it to, I want to share and talk about it with others... but I'm home alone.  
Internet is great, we can access to so much.  
But it's still a lonely process.  
I wanted to create this moment, where we can share these video, watch them together and talk about them.

## What and Why BrainCandy?

As I stand out here in the wonders of the unknown at Hadley, I sort of realize thereâ€™s a fundamental truth to our nature, Man must explore . . . and this is exploration at its greatest.
We are all connected; To each other, biologically. To the earth, chemically. To the rest of the universe atomically.

Houston, Tranquility Base here. The Eagle has landed.
As we got further and further away, it [the Earth] diminished in size. Finally it shrank to the size of a marble, the most beautiful you can imagine. That beautiful, warm, living object looked so fragile, so delicate, that if you touched it with a finger it would crumble and fall apart. Seeing this has to change a man.
