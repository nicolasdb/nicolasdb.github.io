üí° it's not a zombie thing, but a treat for your brain.

## Why?

**Because there is a world of contents already out there**, and we aren‚Äôt all perfect entertainer/director/writer and shit. 

Hopefully, we can already find videos who will explain or illustrate so much better what we have in mind. We don‚Äôt need to do it ourselves every time. 

**We just need to be inspired.** ‚ú®

Because we are social creatures, It's so much better to share IRL online content than watching it on our own computer, alone, with no body to talk about it. We want direct feedback.

And finally because **it feel good to connect** with a group of like minded people.

## For who?

This is not a ‚Äúted talk‚Äù which is  a ‚Äú1 to many‚Äù interaction between a person who do the talk and a public who receive the information. 

‚ÄúBraincandy‚Äù aim to be interactive with everybody. Every participant can react and add to the initial playlist. 

But that imply a threshold not to be cross, a maximum capacity over which ‚Äúparticipants‚Äù become ‚Äúone public‚Äù and the magic stop. 

How to define this threshold? 10? 15?

## What are the objectives?

The ultimate goal is to awake the child inside us and bring back the sparkles in our mind. It‚Äôs to let lose our creativity.

So, the first objective is about sharing a subject we care about.

Then, a very good ‚Äúbraincandy‚Äù should finish with a next step. A call to action, an invitation to meet again and start working on ideas.

*How cool it would be if.... blablabla. ?*

*What if we make that happen? That would be crazy :)*

We should get home with excitement, looking forward the next action.

## How to make it happen?

The rulez are simple:

- we choose a theme
- we select in advance 5/8 videos, 15min max each. *total should not exceed 1h*
- we select a place, with video projector.
- we bring pizza and beer
and we watch them together, with a break to react, discuss about the video, take a slice and a new fresh üç∫ .
Some times, most of the times actually, it bring in mind another video that we watch off course.

<aside>
üí° Braincandy is not a powerpoint, this is a narration. 
A guided brainstorming.
We want to tell a story and take people into a trip.

### how to participate?

Let define some roles. Like 5? What kind of role do we need to organize an event (a braincandy)

We‚Äôll open these to be filled by people from DAO Brussels. 

**Reward:** They get to preview the contents. They receive tokens to evaluate videos. They get to share their point of view and test quadratic voting.
