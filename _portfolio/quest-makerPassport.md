It's a fez. I wear a fez now. Fezzes are cool. I once spent a hell of a long time trying to get a gobby Australian to Heathrow airport. There are fixed points throughout time where things must stay exactly the way they are. This is not one of them. This is an opportunity! Whatever happens here will create its own timeline, its own reality, a temporal tipping point. The future revolves around you, here, now, so do good! Please tell me I didn't get old. Anything but old. I was young! Oh... is he grey?

{% include gallery caption="This is a sample gallery to go along with this case study." %}

Look at me. No plans, no backup, no weapons worth a damn. Oh, and something else I don't have: anything to lose. So, if you're sitting up there with your silly little spaceships and your silly little guns and you've any plans on taking the Pandorica tonight; just remember who's standing in your way. Remember every black day I ever stopped you and then, and then, do the smart thing. Let somebody else try first. Brave heart, Clara. Geronimo! Bow ties are cool. Usually called 'The Doctor.' Or 'The Caretaker.' Or 'Get off this planet.' Though, strictly speaking, that probably isn't a name.

Geronimo! Frightened people. Give me a Dalek any day. I once spent a hell of a long time trying to get a gobby Australian to Heathrow airport. Overconfidence, this, and a small screwdriver. Iâ€™m absolutely sorted. Oh, I always rip out the last page of a book. Then it doesn't have to end. I hate endings! There's something that doesn't make sense. Let's go and poke it with a stick. Look at me. No plans, no backup, no weapons worth a damn. Oh, and something else I don't have: anything to lose. So, if you're sitting up there with your silly little spaceships and your silly little guns and you've any plans on taking the Pandorica tonight; just remember who's standing in your way. Remember every black day I ever stopped you and then, and then, do the smart thing. Let somebody else try first.
