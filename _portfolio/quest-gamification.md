## my exploration on minisite github
### What exploration?

As I stand out here in the wonders of the unknown at Hadley, I sort of realize thereâ€™s a fundamental truth to our nature, Man must explore . . . and this is exploration at its greatest.
We are all connected; To each other, biologically. To the earth, chemically. To the rest of the universe atomically.

{% include gallery caption="This is a sample gallery to go along with this case study." %}

Houston, Tranquillity Base here. The Eagle has landed.
As we got further and further away, it [the Earth] diminished in size. Finally it shrank to the size of a marble, the most beautiful you can imagine. That beautiful, warm, living object looked so fragile, so delicate, that if you touched it with a finger it would crumble and fall apart. Seeing this has to change a man.
