### a while ago...

2016, I was browsing the TED talks and then, I discover this:  

{% include video id="dE1DuBesGYM" provider="youtube" %}
>*Games like World of Warcraft give players the means to save worlds, and incentive to learn the habits of heroes. What if we could harness this gamer power to solve real-world problems? Jane McGonigal says we can, and explains how.*

As a fabmanager, I see myself on a learning path. I didn't study in any academy, _there was none_, I was not hired to do it, _I just did_ and I face any challenges like any other project.  
**I do it myself or not.**   
I learn, I fail, I try again until it work.   

My first step was to buy a 3D printer in kit.  
Of course, I rapidly wanted to do more, to buy more tools, access to others projects, learn more skills...  but this is an expensive and time consuming hobby.  
This is not possible to achieve alone. I needed to join a group, a guild of makers.  
No group around?  
Mhe... I created one then, and share my tools and passion.  

And whitout knowing it _yet_, I answered to my Epic calling, making a fablab, to connect with other likeminded people, to continue to levelUp and face bigger challenges together _like to make a living from it_.  
I feel that's the best way for me to make an impact in this world.  
This is my way to take control of my life.   
**This is how I make sens.**  


## Core mechanics
Have you notice a pattern there?  
This is RPG man, I started to play at "my life"...  
I embarked on an Epic Quest, the fablab, and every projects are missions.  
Some of them are too big of a challenge to face it alone, only a guild could help me found fellow makers to beat these "kicking ass" boss levels and win more loot, xp and money.  
And the secret awesome sauce in all this _aka core mechanics_, is the **leveling process**.  

## Life as a game
Yup, why not?  
But a game doesn't mean this have to be fun and easy all the time.  
Life is hard, it take a lot of efforts to overcome challenges, but this is why the game is worth to play :smile:

## Openfab as a guilde2.0
Learning and design the rules and pathway to discretely guide new members is fudging complex.   
Yup.  
As far as I remember, _since around 2016_, I discovered and learned so much. _I failed a lot also_   

Here is my ideas of the components involved in this.  
- Games are there to teach us things safely so, when the time come, we'll know how to proceed.
- AS SOON AS we have learned our lesson, the game become boring and we need another.  
- The social component of a game will help to create diversity, challenges and unpredictability. Which is good.  
- The learning curve must be smooth and adapted to each members. 7 levels of mastery, from apprentice to ZEN master. **_#accomplishment_**
  - Skills are supported by a badges system and earned based on a documentation loop. **_#socialInfluence_**  
    _You did it, you documented it and it's working, what do you need more?_  
  - A personal portfolio is required to collect the loot and show progress.  
    ![showmewhat](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/12049360/66039764-0c4e2580-e516-11e9-875c-0012b1183709.png)
- The implication curve must be smooth and adapted to each members. 5 levels of subscriptions, from casual user (they don't decide) to "sudo" users (but them do). **_#empowerment_**
  - This is of course linked to the governance system **_#ownership_**
- A local currency to facilitate internal exchanges and social interactions.  
- It is most important to have a Feedback system
- A board or a map, something to help self evaluation and to know what could be the next step.  
  - this is linked to some sort of "a fog of war", you don't need to know everything, just what's on your reach.
- Teams dedicated to specific fields, as the members levelUp, they can join teams to access to more challenges and rewards/loot.  
- The community must encourage **trust** between users, _this is a safe environment_, **initiative** _this is a doocraty_ and of course _with great power, comes great_ **responsibility**
