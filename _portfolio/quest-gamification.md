### a wile ago...

2016, I was browsing the TED talks and then, I discover this:  

{% include video id="dE1DuBesGYM" provider="youtube" %}
>*Games like World of Warcraft give players the means to save worlds, and incentive to learn the habits of heroes. What if we could harness this gamer power to solve real-world problems? Jane McGonigal says we can, and explains how.*

And yeah, indeed, I was, kind of, frustrated by all these little games as "pokemon GO", "sudoku", "candycrush" and other wasting time shit.   
Why is it so difficult to attract people in a fablab, a fun place where the time you spent is to build something and mostly yourself.

## behavior design?

- why are we doing what we do and why we do it this way?
- why is it so difficult to change our behaviors?
- becoming better at doing things better.
- 4 user types
- 8 cores drive
- 16 personalities
- gamification curve
- extrinsic vs intrinsic
- design to nudge





As I stand out here in the wonders of the unknown at Hadley, I sort of realize there’s a fundamental truth to our nature, Man must explore . . . and this is exploration at its greatest.
We are all connected; To each other, biologically. To the earth, chemically. To the rest of the universe atomically.

{% include gallery caption="This is a sample gallery to go along with this case study." %}

Houston, Tranquility Base here. The Eagle has landed.
As we got further and further away, it [the Earth] diminished in size. Finally it shrank to the size of a marble, the most beautiful you can imagine. That beautiful, warm, living object looked so fragile, so delicate, that if you touched it with a finger it would crumble and fall apart. Seeing this has to change a man.

> Today human behaviour is the biggest threat to mankind. We keep overeating, even though we know it´s bad for us. We keep using to much energy, even though we know the planet can't keep up with our consumption. We keep driving too fast, even though we know it kills us. But this doesn't mean that we have no intentions to change. We do. But changing actual human behaviour calls for good design solutions that take basic human instincts, flaws and habits into consideration. That is design to nudge.
