# 3D Printing stuff is easy
I want to have something more stable and useful for everybody in the lab about how to setup and use 3Dprinters.  
I first used printers with a direct USB connection.
`I like that specifically for the direct manual control of the machine.`  
But it's not very ergonomic for the noob, who want to plug and play on everything.

In the past, I used :  
- **replicatorG** (thing-O-matic)
- **Slic3r** (thing-O-matic)
- **Repetier host** (3Drag/K8200) with Slic3r and curaEngine.   

then a couple years ago, I switch to **mattercontrol** who use a fork of curaEngine, curaEngine original and Slic3r for the slicing part.  
This one offer a lot of manual control and a software auto-leveling, very handy when you don't have hardware auto-leveling.  

Of course,  
I tried several time the **Cura software** but the main disadvantage is the lack of .... manual control.  
`Yeah, I really don't trust these automatic stuff because when you build your own printers, you like to have access to these last minute settings to adapt, correct, learn what do what.`

But these days, the new version of Cura is packed with new and advanced functions which is quite cool to work with. And it easily overcome the missing manual control.  

## Basic Setup


## Next step?
Here in the lab, Openfab, we still have several machines to upgrade, levelup and optimise.  
I don't have time to take care of these.  
If you want, you're welcome to help and it's a great way to earn some 3Dprint technical badges and more XP.  
Then you could even access to maintenance jobs that we receive times to times.  

### How to contribute?
- Create setups for each of the printers. Anet A6, E10 and Fabrikators v2.
- Setup Octoprint for a better managment?
- Setup github to log and pull new settings/presets from advanced skilled members.
- I have a geeetech to upgrade, bad Z axis.
- I have a tevo tarantula dual extruder to rebuild and upgrade.
- I have 2 leveling sensors to install.
- I have a M3D micro printer to levelup also, it's working but... mheeee. I don't like their BS software.
