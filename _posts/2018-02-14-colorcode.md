### Context
We are in this place since more than two years, and after some trial and error, I feel we need to get the organization of tools, shelves, boxes, hardware, offices and shit in order.   
I'm the main user so I know where things are. But how to help others users to easily find there way? And more importantly, how can I expect Users to keep the place sorted-out when they left.


## We need a color code
I'm a big fan of Tom Sachs  
Tom who? [you need to watch this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tm-e75FocJU)    

#### What I mean by color code?  
It's like road signs, every body know what means a hexagon red sign, a rectangular blue panel, or a round red and white.   
The form + a color is a basic and universal language.  
It touch our feelings, like Red as danger, Orange or Yellow as warning, Green is safe, etc...   

I want to use this in the lab to create 2 level of reading, of information.  

1. as we enter **everyone can see and identify zones by use.**
  - lasercutting square
  - electronics bench
  - 3D printers bench + shelves
  - Gen toolings shelves
  - assembly high table
  - coworking table
  - Kitchen
  - Admin and storage

  For that, I'll use rectangle blue panel with white name as information.  
  And some black and yellow tape on the floor to raise awareness and limit safety distance or restricted zones.  
  For example:  
  <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/12049360/36531179-58db3938-17bd-11e8-885b-9e5d4bc9b483.png" width="200px">      <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/12049360/36531563-9c1f2898-17be-11e8-9497-41fd2f986056.png" width="200px">   

Also, I want to raise awareness on the things you can interact with, like in video game, things will be highlighted to give you clues on what you can use.   
I have painted some boxes and tools pooch in white then taped and paint in Orange fluo, like that:  
<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/12049360/36033175-84dec318-0db0-11e8-977a-920292f4698f.png" width="400px">   

As a result, I want people see from distance where are things they can use.  
They will come closer and then   

2. another level on information, Like
  - sub-categories of tools,
  - screws, tapes,
  - accessories,
  - and shits.  
Could be with different colors and white texts.

First, you understand you'll find something there:

  Then you'll be able to look for a specific piece of hardware:

## This is a Work In Progress

I have installed some shelves and now, I made lasercutted boxes and now, I'm testing out some colors and names. I'll have to paint and make more of these in different height for smaller parts, but I'm quite please for now with the initial result.

#### Details for boxes is collected on [issue#63](https://github.com/nicolasdb/nicolasdb.github.io/issues/63)
