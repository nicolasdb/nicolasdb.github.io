### Context
We are in this place since more than two years, and after some trial and error, I feel we need to get the organization of tools, shelves, boxes, hardware, offices and shit in order.   
I'm the main user so I know where things are. But how to help others users to easily find there way? And more importantly, how can I expect Users to keep the place sorted-out when they left.

I'm a big fan of Tom Sachs
