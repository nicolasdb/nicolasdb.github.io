> trnslt:_"What's up? We're doing another video game party at the lab. I wanted to know if it was possible to borrow the arcade game. Thanks and have a good weekend!"_

## Alerte générale! 
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/12049360/51194272-02828480-18eb-11e9-86dd-c8326ed798b2.png)

The [Labokube](https://www.labokube.xyz/) is a space for artistic creation and dissemination.
They asked about this barTop last year, and it's still in the same shape - an old, crappy work-in-progress.

It's time to pimp it up.

### Starting with an upgrade of the front panel

I measured and redrew everything in Inkscape to produce files for laser engraving. I tested and adjusted the position of holes, and added the name and design.

After engraving, gluing, clamping, and waiting overnight, I did some finishing and sanding.

I also replaced the hinges and reassembled everything back in its place.

### We need a front cover for the sound system.
Once more, measuring and designing plastic speakers, as well as disassembling them.

The pattern engraved on the surface was created using my special technique to create a 3D bark-like texture on MDF. When varnish is applied, it adds some volume, making it quite interesting to the touch.

*Note: 3 layers and 3 hours to dry between each. I used F1000:10 for engraving then F2500:20 for filling.*

### Now the sides, aka the pain in my basement.
Since I didn't have any drawings for that, I was unable to measure it accurately. To compensate, I taped together some A3 paper sheets to cut and test the template.

I then measured it, tried to take an imprint (kind of lithography), scanned it, and took a picture. I merged all of these together to get something to work with - _mhe, good enough._

It took a while - 4 hours of lasercut - but eventually I was able to engrave and cut both sides. I then screwed the sides in place and flushed the edges with the right router bit.

I had the help of [Julien](https://github.com/Jorgininho) to add and set up a new shutdown button. He also updated the distribution and selected a new set of games.

### And voilà, Job Done.

So, to conclude:  
---
From a hand-made arcade cabinet with no drawings to refer to, I designed the panels from scratch and we performed a full electronic checkup. 
This took a full week, 5 days at 450€, plus 4 to 6 hours of laser engraving and cutting (included in the price). 
This job could be valued at 2250€ plus backoffice and finishing products, bringing the total to 2500€ (VAT included).

So considering the amount of time and effort that went into customizing this Arcade Game, it may be a bit pricey for personal use. However, for a team-building workshop, it could be an amazing opportunity to build something unique together, and be proud of the end result. With the right instruction and guidance from an experienced team, this project could be a great way to foster team spirit and camaraderie. In the end, the price could be easily justified.
