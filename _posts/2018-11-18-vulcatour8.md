In November '18, I was invited to assist Alexandre Rousselet as co-pilot of the Vulca Tour 8, direction East of Brussels.  
The trip took 5 weeks and went through Germany, Czech Republic, Poland, Slovakia, Czech Republic _again_, Germany _again_, Luxembourg and back home.

I visited 37 fablabs, hackerspaces, makerspaces, biolab or even creative lab. _and more for Alex which continue alone in France on his way home_  
I traveled 3971km + train back to Bxl from Arlon.
