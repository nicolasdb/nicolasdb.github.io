## Alerte générale!

They asked that last year already, and the barTop is still in the same shape. Which is... kind of... an old work-in-progress.

It's time to pimp it.

### Start with an upgrade of the front panel

I measured and redraw everything in inkscape to produce files for laser engraving. I have tested and adjusted the position of holes and I add the name and design.

Engraving, gluing, clamping and wait overnight.  
First session: 6h30

Then some finishing and sanding.

Better hinges and reassembling everything back in his place.

### A cover for the sound system
Again, measuring and design

Nice surprise with the pattern engraved, when varnish is applied, it create a nice bark-ish texture and some volume. Very interesting on the touching.

_note: 3 layers and 3h to dry between each. I used 1000:10 for engraving then 2500:20 for filling_

### Sides, the pain in the basement.
Since I don't have any drawings for that. I fail to measure it accurately.  
Each time, I taped together some A3 paper sheets to cut and test the template and I was off.

I measure it, I tried to take an imprint (kind of lithography) then scan it, I took a picture also and tried to merge everything down. This gave me something to work with. _mhe, good enough_  

So, engraving and cutting both sides. It took a wile, 4h of lasersaur later, I screwed the sides in place and flushed the edges with the right router bit.

[Julien](https://github.com/Jorgininho) helped on his side to add and setup a new shutdown button. He updated the distribution also and selected a new set of games.

### Zoup, Job Done.

So, to conclude.  
---
From a hand-made arcade cabinet with no drawings to refer to.  
A design from scratch.  
And a electronic full checkup.   
`It took a full week, 5 days @450€ htva. 4 to 6h of laser engraving and cutting (included)  = 2250€`  
`+ Backoffice and finishing products. Let's say this is a job at 2500€ htva. `
