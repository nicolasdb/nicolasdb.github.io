### Today, I wake up with

#### About the Book

> Sacred Economics traces the history of money from ancient gift economies to modern capitalism, revealing how the money system has contributed to alienation, competition, and scarcity, destroyed community, and necessitated endless growth.

> Today, these trends have reached their extreme - but in the wake of their collapse, we may find great opportunity to transition to a more connected, ecological, and sustainable way of being.

This awesome audiobook who even has a quote of Michel Bauwens on their website

>"If you want a convincing account of just how deep the shift in our new axial age is and must be, look no further than this brilliant book by Charles Eisenstein, one of the deepest integrative thinkers active today."  
*Michel Bauwens, founder of the P2P Foundation*

## what I remember of it?

_even if i'm only at the half of the book_

- nature is so beautiful, no living organism leave any waste who is not a resource for another,...  except humans.
- we are so screwed, thanks to our bad human behaviors.
- putting boundaries, better constraints so we can make better use of what we have, without wasting resources.
- we should have taxes on our waste, or on common resources so people or company will be driven to found better way to be more efficient if they want to make more "profit"
- if we have a lot, we'll be more regardless to spent or to waste.

So it inspire me to know better, to do better and to be better  
for example, this is why [I raised prices](https://nicolasdb.github.io/post/tarifs2018/) or working on a [gamification](https://nicolasdb.github.io/portfolio/quest-gamification/), to define better rules and constraints in the lab, to be more efficient economically but also ingrain better personal behaviors (it's actually more behavior design than game design)
