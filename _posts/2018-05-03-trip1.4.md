## 29 April to 4 Mai
### Zagreb



Meeting @srce  
Roberto invited me to participate on a meeting about a science park, like entertainment park but about science.  
Seams that the idea is around since 10 years now but the city didn't understand the use of it. _Yeah, who care about science right?_   
Until now...  Something append and now, the city would take over the lead and kick the Scientifics out of it. Lol.  
Meanwhile, on the other side of the mountain, another city is offering a better deal....  
_but this is all I understand ^^'_  
One objectives though, they asked to Roberto and the fablab.hr to be part of it and help to create a fablab into the park, and also all around Croatia, like small island of techno-knowHow. Kristina talk about point of acupunctures, where they can activate peoples locally.  

Has I was told, some school are quite poor and parents are asked to give to kids their own toilet paper. (not a joke)
