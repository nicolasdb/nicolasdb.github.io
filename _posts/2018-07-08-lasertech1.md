# Stranger things happened with the laser.  

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/12049360/42418806-5a7a6f2e-82a8-11e8-8452-f24fa0789a28.png)


Like, it cut better at 40% power than at 100%.  
Since, I tried everything.  
- [x] I cleaned everything, optics, bearings, etc...
- [x] I recalibrate optics more than a couple of times.
- [x] I changed mirrors and the lens.
- [x] I changed the power supply (which burned).
- [x] I updated the firmware and software.
- [x] I checked the TTL control signal with oscilloscope.
- [x] I replaced the honeycomb bed (it was dead, not related to the 40% thing.)
- [x] I finally installed a manual firing solution with manual power control (which give an awesome feeling ^^, pew pew pew  )

- [x] And I finally bought a laser power probe.

## Probing the laser tube for power issue

I had a good idea why we didn't get full power from the tube. I is kind of old now, more than 3 years old, but I was expected something more progressive and I felt strange this behavior.  
And of course, I was hopping not to have to buy a new tube which is quite expensive.  

Anyway, just to be sure and better understand what's happening under the hood.  
I bought a probe. (expensive too)  
It look like a cooking thermometer.

Ok then, I started to probe some shit from it.  
For a 100W tube, the beam have to burn the black end for 15sec exactly.  
I prepared a table and checked the power related to the ampere sent by the PSU. 3>25mA.

mA | Power | Readings 09/06/2018
:--: | :--: | :--:
3 | 12% | 0%
4 | 16% | 4%
5 | 20% | 9%
8 | 32% | 28%
10 | 40% | 44%
11 | 44% | 43%
12 | 48% | 43%
13 | 52% | 41%
14 | 56% | 40%
16 | 64% | 40%
18 | 72% | 38%
20 | 80% | 34%
25 | 100% | 28%

So, the red line (readings) should be close to the blue one (theory)

### Time for a reality check.
The laser is dead.

## Replacing the tube

- be sure to unplug everything. You are alone in this, if you die from electrocution.
- Unmount panels.
- Check wiring of manual firing solution, take picture to not forget. ;)
- Unplug everything linked to HT power supply.
- transfer to new connecteur with 5V on the left (not the same PSU)

5V | TH | TL | WP | G | IN

symbole | type | description
-- | -- | --
5V | Output Power | output of 5V, as reference for linear pot. (manual fire : power adjust)

G | Signal Ground | The frame must be connected with laser machine's enclosure and ground properly.
IN | Input Signal | Max Laser Power control, can use 0-5V Analog Signal Control

- Disconnect cable from tube. Red on the left, White on the right.
- Emptying the cooling system, there is a drain on the bottom back side of the chiller. (there is more than 7 liter, be prepared)
- Disconnect water Outlet first. Water will continue to get out trough inlet. (+ side)  
`It's best to heat the tube, it will "ramolir" and will be easy to get it off.`
- when no water left. Disconnect the inlet.
- take out the tube
- put the new one in place, put ONE layer of the rubber thingy tape each side.  
`(= some comfort and same thickness both side)`   
- Adjust what is loose. And fix the tube with one set of ziptie.   
Just enough to secure it during replacing water tubing on inlet and outlet.  
**Inlet MUST be bottom, Outlet MUST be on top**  
To naturally help the air bubble to stay out of the cooling system.

- Install the power supply.

- Fill up the cooler with distilled water. One bottle of 5 liter is good for now.
- Power on the chiller.
Check for air bubble in the tube. If there is. Turn off then on again the chiller, it usually get rid of the last bubble.
- Secure the tube.
- check again the level of water of the chiller.  
The level will drop since a part of the water went to the tube. Adjust level until the upper green limit. Just to be nicely full.

`yeah, outlet of the chiller become inlet of the tube, outlet of the tube become inlet of the chiller. That right. +1 for who noticed the ziptie's color code ;)`

- connect HT white wire from tube (- pole) to the amp meter on the left pole.
- connect the right pole (amp meter) to the HT power supply cable.
- Test to fire the tube, after turning on the power for chiller and the laser PSU.  

`Check if the door is closed, it would trigger the safety and nothing will append. Same as the chiller if not powered on. `
- Adjust the PSU amp to 25mA as max power setting. For best lifespan. Over 27mA, the tube will have more power but will burn more quickly.

## YEAH, it burn baby.

As always, Be extra careful with laser PSU,
![9000](https://media.giphy.com/media/fijRLk7GeRsVa/giphy.gif)  
 (actually, it's over 40.000V)  
It's very High Tension power and it could kill you.  
Be careful and remember. You

### Installing the laser Hour Meter
This is a new add-on to have a real count of the lifespan of the tube.

Wind the black wire's counter around the laser red wire. 5 times.   
And push the other end into the laser hour meter.  
Install the meter were you want for an easy readings.

## Next step.
- Recalibrate optics.
- Redo a probing graph.
