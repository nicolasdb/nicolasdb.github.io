I was asked for mentoring someone on fusion360, just to be autonomous on his own projet. 
it's about showing shortcuts, tips and being there if he's getting stuck on something. 

Proposition:
- subscribing as a member
- 120â‚¬/day, package for a day at the lab like coworking + 2h of mentoring where I sit with you.
for ex. 1h in the morning to start for the day, then 1h spread on the day for questions.
