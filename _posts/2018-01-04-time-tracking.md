Well.   
Finally got around to put this old website together.    
Neat thing about it - powered by [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) and I can use Markdown to author my posts.   
**-> It's actually a lot easier than I thought it was going to be.  :muscle:**

## note
Actually, this was my second attempt on gh-pages but still the first post.  
The first one was this one   
**[gitmini0](https://nicolasdb.github.io/gitmini0)**  

And the second website is here but a bit broken since the new version    
**[gitMiniBlog](https://nicolasdb.github.io/gitMiniBlog)**
