## 28 April
### FABelgrade

![teamFab]("/assets/images/post/FABelgradeOG-th.jpg")

I'm late of course, I took the bus till the center (50min) then a cab to the next rbnb (10min)   
Meet with Lazar for the checkIn. Then walk back to the Youth Center (20min)  

I finally arrived at 15h, [here was the program](http://www.fabelgrade.io/program/)

### Anyway,
From there, I met a lot of peoples, not everyone but quite a lot, and I will not go through it in details BUT here what will be directly useful for my trip and maybe some leads for later.  

_I need to be more effective in my writings, I feel like taking more time to write than to live the events._
