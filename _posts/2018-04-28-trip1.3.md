## 28 April
![teamFab](/assets/images/post/FABelgradeOG-th.jpg)

I'm late of course, I took the bus till the center (50min) then a cab to the next rbnb (10min)   
Meet with Lazar for the checkIn. Then walk back to the Youth Center (20min)  

I finally arrived at 15h, [here was the program](http://www.fabelgrade.io/program/)

### Anyway,
From there, I met a lot of peoples, not everyone but quite a lot, and I will not go through it in details BUT here what will be directly useful for my trip and maybe some leads for later.  

_I need to be more effective in my writings, I feel like taking more time to write than to live the events._

## So we talked about:
Yup, that was a rich couple of days. I'll keep it brief but we can talk about more using [issues on my github](https://github.com/nicolasdb/nicolasdb.github.io/issues/), feel at ease to ask questions. (FR/EN welcome)
### making Network
There is a big energy into fablabs to create and activate networks in all forms.  
We gather there with [FablanNet](http://www.interreg-central.eu/Content.Node/FabLabNet.html), the first fablab network for central Europe, and members of [Vulca project](vulca.eu)+[Réseaux des fablabs Français](http://www.fablab.fr/), there was also Bart Bakker from fablab Benelux and maybe me as someone from the network we want to create in Brussels. ^^  
That's nice, there is a lot of challenges though. And it's strange to me that we start to want to network but we actually don't know to do what?  
It's very difficult to work together, each fablabs as their own rules and structure, it's already a lot of work to overcome the challenge we all face inside. And to add on top of that a big coat of complexity and the "long distance relationship" problem.   
Mmmm, this extra work should create a lot of win/win situation to be sustainable.  

For example, my trip here, is first to help me find new ideas and solutions to bring back home. Then of course, if in the process I can help and exchange ideas and leads. It will be with pleasure.  
The good news here, is we basically all face very similar challenges.

### how to empower community?
Another common questions are   
- how to engage people into the community?
- Once they are engaged and now, skilled in the art of "fablabing". How to keep them? aka how to pay them?
- and finally, how to create recognition in skills learn into fablabs/maker/hackerspaces?

I feel that theses questions are a big part of why we have the need to gather as networks.

### gender equity
Then during the talk, the question about "gender equality" came in. Because, as Fabmanager there, we were mostly men.  
But in reality, we should not judge the book by it's cover. We all agree that as soon as we are an open and caring community, most of the time, there is more woman than men in the fablab.

In Openfab, we discuss about that.  
We don't have gender or exclusive something, but we are not equal at all. Instead, like any ecosystem, we need to embrace diversity to do great things.  
And I'll quote Anne-Camille ( github: @zuperninja ) here who resume perfectly the recipe to be an inclusive group of people:
>- pas oublier que nous sommes tous des humains    >> don't forget we're all humans
- checker nos privilèges et les accepter  >> check our privilege and be ok with it
- demander, écouter, s'entraider  >> ask, listen, help
- rester curieux de l'autre  >> stay curious about each other
- être bienveillant  >> be nice to each other


### fablab mobile
And then, like always. I had to travel 25h bus to finely meet Bart Bakker who live 2h away from Brussels.  
He founded the smallest fablab in Netherland, [minifablab.nl](http://www.minifablab.nl/) and work also on a [fablab mobile project.](http://www.minifablab.nl/trikes-and-bikes/)  
> I am working now on the MAKERKAR, a Library Makercart 112x70x128 with a full minifablab on board to go to libraries. And schools. Open source. Replicable everywhere in the world for libraries, schools, hospitals etc. With an air filter for inhouse use. Prototype mid March 2018.

_hey, velom2 is there too_ :D

Then the fablabNet work also on a "fabbox" concept. Modules with all the tools, not to fit on bike but to fit into a van. I'll discuss that next time in Ljubljana with [roglab.si](http://roglab.si/en) who is part of this network.

### wear sustain
Then I met Stavri nikolov, Director of [the Digital Spaces Living Lab (DSLL)](http://www.digitalspaces.info/) in Sofia, Bulgaria.  
Which develops and tests new technologies, services and apps for digital media, wearables, lifelogging, museums, and smart cities.

They are in the wear sustain program and was interested to know more and maybe, it could really nice organise someting during next automn and travel to Sofia, with some members into that kind on domain.  

### Biomimicry
And then, I had a chance to talk a little bit with Ivana Gadjanski, who ogranised and present FABelgrade. She is a neuroscientist, and we started to think about what kind of analogy we could make between brain, networks, what are the essentials parts and tasks needed to sustain a network, as an ecosystem of things.  
Haaaa, I love these smalls talks.  

It's actually started a little bit earlier with I don't remember who (sorry). The idea came about seeing fablab as several acupunctures points, from were we can activate and support specifics functions in the city, help to restore the energy flow into the body.     

### where to after?
And then, then Roberto Vdović, [fablab.hr](fablab.hr), we are colleagues in the Vulca project and I'll go bakc to Zagreb with him. We have a lot to talk about during the 4h trip. :)
And I'll come back to Meta štular who's in charge (I think) for the fablab Roglab in Ljubljana.
