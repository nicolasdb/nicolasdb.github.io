### Surfing the wave
At this point, I had a pretty smooth feeling.  
I just bought a bus ticket to Belgrade without planning anything and from there, everything came into place.  
I caught a ride to Zagreb with Roberto, then again to Vienna. There I met François and catch his ride to where he live and work [Roglab](roglab.si), Ljubljana.  
My next destination.

It was also a nice opportunity to join the Vulca team for a conference and make new fabmanager friends.

### Makerfaire
To tell the truth, I'm a bit bored of these events, it's nice and important and everything but It's not my first rodeo, and I spend my time in a fablab every days. So there is nothing new for me there.  
I made the tour in less than an hour and still had to spend 2 days there, T_T  
But!  
There was theses guys, I don't remember the name, they are just some friends making stuff in their garage and they were the best:

_Quick&dirty booth_

_No shit were given there too._  

Special love for the retro arcade game cabinet with just a old CRT TV and a real superNES in a time where everybody is so excited about raspberryPi retro console emulators.  
These ones make me laugh, and even if everything was super Quick&Dirty, everything was working.

For me, it is the best kind of examples to show in a makerfaire, where everybody work a lot to show off their best and more perfect project, which I think is quite intimidating for the public.  

**Please, don't forget:**  
A maker learn by doing, and it's ok to fail. Or to not finish som...
