# Nicolas de Barquin: Master Autodidact

"From Making Things to Making Sense: 
My journey of turning a passion into a career, and a career into a path of self-discovery"

I'm Nicolas, an autodidact and maker. This blog is a record of my journey, successes and failures alike. It's also a way to share what I've learned and discovered, and to help others who may be interested in the same topics.

At the heart of my journey, I'm striving for balance. This balance is between my work and personal life. My passions drive me, but I'm also striving to maintain control and keep them from taking over.

By sharing my experiences, I hope to inspire others to explore and learn something new each day. This blog is a place to document and share the journey, and I'm excited to create and share more.

Work in progress,   
I'm learning a bit of CSS so I can update myself the style of pages.   

This website is hosted via super.so for the no-code setup, and notion.so who serve as database and backoffice.   
I love so much this shit. <3  
I'll discontinue for now github pages where I spent too much time on code versus content.
