My portfolio website as a maker and fabmanager



Nicolas de Barquin is the founder and manager of the fablab Openfab, started 8 years ago in Brussels.
Multipotentialist, he uses his curiosity to explore other ways to learn and make. This leads him on the subject of documentation in fablabs and behavior design.
Today, after learning how to upgrade tools and machines in the fablab, his question now, is how to hack our own brain to gain better habits and how to level up ourself.
