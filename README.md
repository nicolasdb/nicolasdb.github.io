# Nicolas de Barquin: Master Autodidact

"From Making Things to Making Sense: 
My journey of turning a passion into a career, and a career into a path of self-discovery"

I'm Nicolas, an autodidact and maker. This blog is a record of my journey, successes and failures alike. It's also a way to share what I've learned and discovered, and to help others who may be interested in the same topics.

At the heart of my journey, I'm striving for balance. This balance is between my work and personal life. My passions drive me, but I'm also striving to maintain control and keep them from taking over.

By sharing my experiences, I hope to inspire others to explore and learn something new each day. This blog is a place to document and share the journey, and I'm excited to create and share more.

Work in progress,    
I'm learning some CSS so I can update the style of my pages. I will store my setings here.    

This website is hosted by [super.so](https://super.so/) for the no-code setup, and [notion.so](https://www.notion.so/) serves as the database and back office.   

I really love this stuff. ❤️ I will discontinue GitHub Pages, where I spent too much time on code instead of content.
